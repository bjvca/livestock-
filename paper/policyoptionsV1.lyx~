Increase prices for cattle as a raw input in the value chain

Whether economic agents benefit or lose from changes in prices depends on
 wheter they participate in the market mainly as sellers or as buyers.

Increase intertemporal price arbitrage

\begin_layout Standard
Barrett et al 2004 also indicate that pastoralist housheolds in Ethiopia
 participate in livestock markets, but in relatively small volumes and at
 varying rates over time.
 In pastoralist areas livestock are sold to meet family cash nees to purchase
 food and clothes and pay for medical and educational expenses.
 Since livestock is the main store of wealth and formal credit markets are
 limited at best, this suggests timing of sales is largely determined by
 cash needs.
 Better prices could be obtained if pastoralists would be able to postpone
 time of sales up to the point when prices are highest.
 This problem becomes more important when these cash needs are common, which
 is likely to be the case for educational expenses.
 Since several pastoralists will try to sell their animals at the same time,
 this is likely to increase the price difference between the price they
 get and the price they could get when prices attain their seasonal maximum.

\begin_layout Standard
A promising policy response would be to provide credit that can be used
 to cover such expenses.
 A similar system as the popular livestock receipt systems could be devised
 for pastoralists.
 One of the main challenges would be to overcome the moral hazard problem
 that comes into play when the money has been given and the animal has been
 taken as collateral.
