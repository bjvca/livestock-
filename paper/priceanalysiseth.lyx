\begin_layout Title
Policy options for reducing vulnerability in conflict-prone areas: Livestock
 market dynamics in pastoralist areas of Ethiopia
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author
Bjorn Van Campenhout, Derek Headey and Bart Minten
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
The very nature of pastoralist livelihoods in the Arid and Semi Arid Lands
 (asal) means exposure to substantial vulnerability.
 Cattle, the main productive asset doubles as a store of wealth.
 As such, the buffer stock provided by wealth can not be used as insurance
 against adverse shocks that affect productive assets.
 This vulnerability could be reduced substantially through monetization
 of parstoralist livelihoods.
 Indeed, over the last decades, there are signs that some markets that focus
 on live cattle export to Sudan and further to the Arabian peninsula have
 been booming.
 Still, the majority of pastoralists' interactions with the market remains
 low, with frequency and timing determined by immediate cash needs.
 We look at what structural factors are responsible for the growth of the
 export markets, and ask if lessons can be learned to increase market participat
ion in poorly integrated pastoralist systems.

Market Integration - Concept and Methods
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The basic idea behind spatial market integration is discussed in the classical
 works of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "takayama1971spatial"

\end_inset

.
 This theory boils down that the fact that, in a setting with free flow
 of information and goods, prices of a homogeneous good in two spatially
 separated markets should only differ by the transaction cost
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Transaction cost should be broadly defined.
 While transportation costs are obvious, transaction costs may also include
 non-tariff barriers, search costs,...
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 This is so because, if the price in one market is larger than the price
 in another market plus the transaction cost that would be involved if one
 had to move the product from the market with the low price to the market
 with the high price, unexploited profits would exist.
 Rational traders would therefore enter the market and capitalize on these
 arbitrage opportunities, increasing demand in the market where prices are
 low and increasing supply in the location where prices are high.
 These latter two forces will, 
\emph on
ceteris paribus
\emph default
, drive up the price in the market that had initially a low price and reduce
 the price in the market that had initially a high price.
 The end result will be that prices adjust up to the point where trade becomes
 unprofitable again, i.e.
 until the price difference becomes equal to the transaction cost.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Defined as above, one would need to compare the price margins with the cost
 of transaction to makes statements on the extent of market integration.
 However, this comparison is difficult due to the fact that transaction
 costs incorporate a sizable unmeasured (and often unmeasurable) component,
 such as the cost of risk related to contract monitoring, enforcement, search
 costs, etc 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "NewEntry7"

\end_inset

.
 But the above also suggests that one can assess the degree of market interconne
ctedness by looking at the behavior of prices of a homogeneous good in different
 markets.
 Hence, the first studies on market integration looked at simple correlations
 between prices of a homogeneous good in different markets.
 Realizing that most price series are non-stationary, market integration
 became synonymous to co-integration of price series in the 1980s and 1990s.
 However, the non-linear adjustment process of prices, with adjustment of
 prices different depending on the price margin larger or smaller than the
 transaction cost, resulted in low power of co-integration tests.
 Currently, there are two models in use that address this issue.
 Models based on threshold auto-regression are close to the co-integration
 and error-correction approach, but allow for a band formed by transaction
 costs.
 The Parity Bounds model estimates the probability of price differences
 being below, on or above the transaction cost.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although a significant improvement over the models that disregarded transaction
 cost, the PBM and TAR models have their shortcomings too.
 A first criticism on the PBM concerns its underlying distributional assumptions.
 The original model identifies three exhaustive regimes, based on the price
 difference between two markets.
 Either this price difference is equal to the transaction cost (regime 1),
 above the transaction cost (regime 2) or below the transaction cost (regime
 3).
 In the switching regressions model, regime 1 is modeled as a constant (i.e.
 the transaction cost) plus a normally distributed error term.
 For regime 2, an additional error term is added, while for regime 3, the
 additional error term is subtracted.
 This additional error term is assumed to be half normal distributed truncated
 from below at zero.
 After formulating the corresponding density functions for each regime,
 probabilities are assigned to each regime, and the likelihood function
 can be specified.
 Maximizing the log of this function returns estimates for the probabilities
 of being in one of the tree regimes, the transaction cost, and the standard
 errors of both error terms 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "New3"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, suppose the price difference between two markets falls in regime 2,
 where it is larger than the transaction cost.
 Indeed, in this case there are profitable arbitrage opportunities that
 remain unexploited.
 It seems logical here to assume a half-normal distribution, because the
 probability of observing large deviations from the transaction cost is
 lower than the probability of observing smaller deviations.
 Obviously, economic reasoning suggests that in this regime, there are limits
 at to how big the discrepancy between the price margin and the transaction
 cost can become.
 However, this is not necessarily true for regime 3.
 If there is no trade between two markets because the price margin is lower
 than the transaction cost, there is no reason why a smaller deviation from
 the parity bounds should occur at a higher probability than a large deviation,
 as suggested by the half normal distribution underlying the model.
 One would expect that in this regime, any price difference has the same
 probability of occurrence.
 The story is somehow different if there is trade occurring in this regime.
 In that case, it might be that temporarily, too much trade is going on.
 These ‘errors’ will be corrected sooner or later; hence here a half normal
 distribution seems to come closer to what economic theory predicts

It is important to note that the original model was developed with such
 a market structure in mind.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 were looking at two markets where one was indisputably the exporter and
 the other the importer (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "New3"

\end_inset

,p.
 571).
 They were looking at a situation of two markets that were linked by continuous
 trade, and their interpretation was that regime 3 reflects a situation
 where there is simply too much trade (glut).
 Most other studies using the PBM have analyzes quite different market settings,
 including situations where reversal of trade is likely.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The point made above is related to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Fackler2001971"

\end_inset

, who argue that “[Switching regressions models] can be viewed as nothing
 more than flexible models of the price spread distribution.
 The believability of the regime interpretation rests very strongly on the
 believability of the distributional assumptions (p.
 1012)”
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Although they argue that the distributional assumptions are arbitrary because
 economic theory generally has little to say about the distribution, we
 feel that theory does say something about the type of adjustment that can
 be expected.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 As explained above, in a setting where markets are not logically linked
 by continuous trade, there is no reason to assume any adjustment in regime
 3.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The parity bounds model is also static in nature
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This problem has been acknowledged from the beginning.
 For instance, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "New3"

\end_inset

 introduce some dynamics to their model by comparing the price of the exporting
 market to the lagged price of the importing market.
 However, this still not informs us on how persistent deviations from efficient
 arbitrage are.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 It informs the researcher of the probabilities of being for instance off
 the parity bounds, but does tell us anything about how persistent these
 deviations from the equilibrium are.
 As already pointed out by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "ravallion1986testing"

\end_inset

, “in many settings it will be implausible that trade adjusts instantaneously
 to spatial price differentials… But, given enough time, the short-run adjustmen
ts might exhibit a pattern which converges to such an equilibrium (p.
 103)”.
 Sluggishness in price adjustment, delays in transportation and expectations
 formation under price uncertainty are mentioned as the prime causes for
 these delays in price adjustment.
 Indeed, one can imagine markets that are prone to frequent supply and demand
 shocks.
 Using a static model like the parity bounds model, one would observe a
 high frequency of inefficient arbitrage (i.e.
 too little or too much trade), and hence conclude that these markets are
 poorly integrated.
 If one would use a dynamic specification instead, one can assess the time
 it takes for prices to adjust to one another.
 If the price differences tend to be corrected quickly, one would come to
 a different conclusion than the one obtained by the PBM.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The TAR model has two main shortcomings.
 First of all, there is the assumption that the transaction cost is constant
 over time
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Strictly speaking, this is also a shortcoming in the switching regression
 models that only rely on price data.
 The subsequent PBM of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "baulch1997transfer"

\end_inset

 relies on exogenous transaction cost data, and hence is a level II study.
 Similarly, one can also use transaction cost data in a TAR framework, which
 would allow a less restrictive threshold model, but again, this would result
 in a level II study.
 As said above, this study will only be concerned what is possible within
 the first level of studies.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Another issue concerns inference on the threshold parameters.
 Chan (1993) has shown that the asymptotic distribution of the threshold
 parameter is neither normal nor nuisance parameter free, hence it is not
 possible to obtain standard errors and confidence intervals.
 Recurring to simulation based methods to obtain standard errors is not
 feasible in practice, as the grid search involved in the estimation takes
 too much time.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
The Model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The model derives from a simple law of one price analysis.
 According to the theory, prices of a homogeneous commodity in two locations
 should not differ by more than the cost of moving the commodity from the
 location where the commodity has the lowest price to the location where
 the commodity has the highest price.
 This cost of moving the commodity should be interpreted in a broad way,
 incorporating for instance also the cost of insuring the goods, the cost
 of the capital that is needed to carry out the operation, vehicles needed,
 etc.
 We will denote this total cost as the transaction cost.
 For simplicity, we will assume that this transaction cost is symmetric,
 meaning that it costs the same to ship goods from location A to B than
 from B to A.
 This would be the case if both locations are at the same altitude and back-load
ing is not possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we define the price in market A of a commodity at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 to be 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}^{A}$
\end_inset

and the price of the same commodity in location B at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 to be 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}^{B}$
\end_inset

, the law of one price states that:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left\Vert P_{t}^{A}-P_{t}^{B}\right\Vert \leq TC
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where 
\begin_inset Formula $TC$
\end_inset

 denotes a constant transaction cost.
 If this condition holds, we say markets are perfectly integrated.
 However, the inequality will not hold exactly at all points in time.
 As arbitrage is often a time consuming process, the degree of market integratio
n will be less than perfect.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left\Vert P_{t}^{A}-P_{t}^{B}\right\Vert \leq T_{t}+\epsilon_{t}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon\sim N\left(0,\sigma^{2}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Such a model can be written as 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left\Vert P_{t}^{A}-P_{t}^{B}\right\Vert =\begin{cases}
\rho.\left\Vert P_{t-1}^{A}-P_{t-1}^{B}\right\Vert +\epsilon_{t\;}if & \left\Vert P_{t-1}^{A}-P_{t-1}^{B}\right\Vert >\tau\\
\epsilon_{t\;}if & \left\Vert P_{t-1}^{A}-P_{t-1}^{B}\right\Vert \leq\tau
\end{cases}\label{eq:tar}
\end{equation}

\begin_layout Section*
Searching for structural changes in transaction costs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this article, we will extend the TAR model such that we can use it to
 look for structural changes in market integration.
 This will necessitate us to make the parameters that jointly enable us
 to judge the extent of market integration, the transaction cost and the
 adjustment speed, a function of time.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most studies implement TAR models as a grid search using the residual sum
 of squared errors as a criterion.
 This means that the researcher needs to define a step value for the parameters
 to be estimated.
 For instance, if the transaction cost is modeled as a simple function of
 time 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{t}=\alpha+\beta t$
\end_inset

, then a two dimensional grid needs to be created, and for both 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

, minimum and maximum values should be defined, as well as steps.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will take a slightly different approach.
 First of all, instead of taking the residual sum of squares as the criterion,
 we will maximize the likelihood function of

\begin_layout Standard
This is a highly erratic function and non-differentiable.
 Differential Evolution methods optimize a problem by iteratively trying
 to improve a candidate solution with regard to a given measure of quality.
 Such methods are commonly known as metaheuristics as they make few or no
 assumptions about the problem being optimized and can search very large
 spaces of candidate solutions.
 DE is used for multidimensional real-valued functions but does not use
 the gradient of the problem being optimized, which means DE does not require
 for the optimization problem to be differentiable as is required by classic
 optimization methods such as gradient descent and quasi-newton methods.
 DE can therefore also be used on optimization problems that are not even
 continuous, are noisy, change over time, etc
